## AeroUI

AeroUI is a prototype automotive infotainment system designed to explore touchless, gesture-based interaction inside vehicles. The project focuses on reducing driver distraction by replacing touchscreen and voice-based controls with intuitive mid-air hand gestures detected using an in-cabin camera.

The system enables gesture-driven control of core infotainment functions such as volume adjustment, climate control, and music playback. Hand movements are tracked in real time and mapped to predictable actions, allowing drivers to interact with the interface without physically touching the display.

## Project Timeline

| Date | Time | Phase | Description |
|-----|------|-------|-------------|
| Jan 9, 2026 | 12:00 PM | Project Initialization | Started the project using Django for the backend and React for the frontend. Basic file structure and project initialization were completed. |
| Jan 9, 2026 | 1:30 PM | Structure Refinement | Identified and fixed issues in the initial file structure. Finalized a clean and stable project skeleton. |
| Jan 9, 2026 | 3:30 PM | Core Gesture Tracking | Implemented real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe. Built a virtual pointer that allows users to navigate UI elements without touching the screen. This became the core navigation mechanism of the infotainment system. |
| Jan 9, 2026 | 8:30 PM | Gesture Control Integration | Integrated full gesture control with live tracking. Added gesture mappings for volume, temperature, music navigation, mute, and unmute. UI development was partial, with priority given to validating gesture logic. |
| Jan 9, 2026 | 10:15 PM | Performance Review | Observed memory usage and latency issues during UI development. Identified limitations of the React and Django stack for automotive deployment. Considered embedded UI and FastAPI as a more optimized architectural alternative. |
| Jan 10 2026 | 3.50 AM | Performance Updated | Added the more optimised version with QML and FastApi along with the previous one which was developed.This New version is more faster and uses less memory which is more optimal for Android Auto OS and for car infotainment systems. |.
| Jan 10 2026 | 9.00 AM | UI Updated | Added some more buttons and aclean sleek ui using buttons for volume control and temperature control which can be controlled by the gestures.Also navigation maps and amusic player sysytem is also added in the car infotainment system |.
